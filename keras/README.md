# BigDL Keras Tutorial

This notebook tutorial set will introduce you how to use the new 
[BigDL Keras API](https://bigdl-project.github.io/0.5.0/#KerasStyleAPIGuide/keras-api-python/)
to fastly build deep learning model and execute training on it in fewer steps. The context of the tutorials are originated and
modified from examples and illustrations in the [MXNet-the-straight-dope](https://gluon.mxnet.io/) series. We share the same gist but the code has 
BigDL-Keras style.
